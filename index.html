                    My name is Revan, renowned as the Revanchist, dreaded as the Sith Lord Darth Revan, and honored as the Prodigal Knight. I was an eminent Jedi Knight turned Dark Lord of the Sith until, stripped of my true persona, I returned to the crumbling Jedi Order
                    and helped defeat the Sith Empire I had established. I am a human male, and acknowledged as a very gifted and powerful Force-sensitive pupil, I was trained as a Padawan by Kreia and a number of other Jedi Masters, both on Coruscant
                    and at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always possessed incredible determination and intelligence, constantly seeking new ways of accomplishing what I see as right. The Mandalorian wars have given me a very cold attitude that makes it so I will seek victory despite the cost. However,
                    I prefer avoiding needless carnage, which is why I built the assassin droid HK-47. Nevertheless, I was utterly ruthless as a Sith and was also highly dedicated to Sith ideals and believing power is everything, ignoring any ideals of
                    mercy or loyalty. My ideals helped influence Darth Bane to create the Rule of Two as I believed that a Sith Master should have one apprentice to avoid being overcome by multiple lesser followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am extremely powerful in the ways of the Force and masterful in combat with a lightsaber. I possess high agility, speed, and strength boosted by the Force that I use in my fighting style. I mostly use one lightsaber, but wields two as dark Revan, both
                    my red Sith one and my original purple one. I am also an extremely cunning and able military commander, an expert with my tactics and strategies. I am respected by several cultures as the epitome of a warrior and commander, as well
                    as very charismatic in recruiting allies. I am fluent in several languages, mechanically minded, skilled at constructing droids, and a talented pilot. I am extremely powerful with the Force, and a true master of the Dark Side as a
                    Sith Lord.
